Ms Maria Iksińska wrote a cookbook that became a bestseller on the cookbook market in Poland and asked us to prepare a meal planning application for her readers.
The book of Mrs. Iksińska promotes healthy eating and emphasizes the importance of planning meals in it. She wants to start running workshops across the country
